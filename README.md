# Horiseon semantic HTML upgrade

## Description

A project whose goal is replace legacy HTML tags in Horiseon's gateway/landing page (index.html) with semantic tags where applicable, and to make the necessary
corresponding alterations to the corresponding style.css page.

An additional objective of this project is the consolidation of CSS styles where possible and the realignment of some of those styles so that semantic flow of styles better supports the semantic flow of the document they support.

- This project was motivated by the need to increase the accessibility of the Horeiseon landing page.
- Pursuing this project will enable automated web readers, such as those used by people with visual disability, to more completely and correctly interpret the
content of this landing page.
- Making these changes not only increases accessibility but also makes the HTML content better able to be read by
future developers since the semantics/meaning of the various sections and elements are now made explicitly clear by the HTML tags and associated styles used.
- In completing this project, the following have been learned:
    - Use of semantic elements in HTML
    - Use of element styles in CSS
    - How to both decrease the size and increase the readability and consistency of CSS by consolidating identical styles

## Installation

For users of the Horiseon landing page, there is no installation needed beyong having a browser.  (see [Usage](#usage))

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
